HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC DUNGEONS

Project made with pygame.

Controls:
 - WASD/arrows for walking and rotating
 - Q and E for attacking with lighting bolt/sword
 - P for pause
 - R for invincibility mode (used when yellow bar is at least a third full)
 
 To craft pickaxe/axe you need to beat Troglodyte monsters and gain wood or ore.
Tools are needed to harvest existing resources on the map.

1) Run "Installer.bat"
 This will install python 3.9, pip package manager
and the libraries and modules required for the game to work.

2) Run the shortcut "Heroes of Might and Magic Dungeons"
and enjoy the game.

Have fun!
